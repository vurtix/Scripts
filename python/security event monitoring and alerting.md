This is a Python script that can automate a wide range of tasks and processes for a SOC analyst. It uses Elasticsearch to perform multiple searches for different types of security events and retrieve the results, with advanced features such as a time range, search size, aggregation, and alerting.

The script is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to specify the search queries, indices, time ranges, sizes, and alert conditions for each search. This allows you to monitor and analyze a wide range of network security events, quickly and easily identify potential threats and anomalies, and automate the process of alerting and notification.

You could add support for other security tools and systems, such as Splunk, Crowdstrike, or Zscaler, by adding APIs and libraries for those tools and systems, and modifying the script to use them. This would allow you to use the script to monitor and analyze data from multiple sources, and to integrate the data and alerts with those tools and systems. 

*Here is an example of how you could integrate the script with Splunk:*
```

#!/usr/bin/python

import os
import sys
import json
import requests
import splunklib.client as splunk

# Set the Elasticsearch URL
elasticsearch_url = "https://elasticsearch.example.com"

# Set the Elasticsearch username and password
username = "elastic_user"
password = "elastic_password"

# Set the Splunk URL, username, and password
splunk_url = "https://splunk.example.com"
splunk_username = "splunk_user"
splunk_password = "splunk_password"

# Set the search queries
search_queries = [
  {
    "name": "Failed Logins",
    "query": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "event_id": "4625"
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "failed_logins_by_user": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "user_name.keyword",
            "size": 10
          }
        },
        "failed_logins_by_source_ip": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "source_ip.keyword",
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "index": "winlogbeat-*",
    "time_range": {
      "range": {
        "@timestamp": {
          "gte": "now-1h"
        }
      }
    },
    "size": 10000,
    "alert": {
      "condition": {
        "compare": {
          "ctx.payload.hits.total": {
            "gte": 1000
          }
        }
      },
      "actions": {
        "send_email": {
          "email": {
            "to": "admin@example.com",
            "subject": "Failed Login Alert",
            "body": "The number of failed logins in the last hour has exceeded 1000. Here are the top 10 users and IP addresses:\n\nUsers:\n{{ctx.payload.aggregations.failed_logins_by_user.buckets}}\n\nIP Addresses:\n{{ctx.payload.aggregations.failed_logins_by_source_ip.buckets}}"
          }
        },
        "send_to_splunk": {
          "webhook": {
            "method": "POST",
            "url": splunk_url + "/services/collector",
            "headers": {
              "Authorization": "Splunk " + splunk.token,
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "body": "{{ctx.payload}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Suspicious Processes",
    "query": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "event_id": "4688"
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "suspicious_processes_by_user": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "user_

```
This demonstrates how you can add support for the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) API, and modify the script to use it. This would allow you to use the script to monitor and analyze security events from Elasticsearch, and to send the results to Splunk for indexing and analysis. This would enable you to use the full power of the Splunk platform to search, analyze, and visualize the security events, and to integrate the data and alerts with other security tools and systems. For example, you could use Splunk to create dashboards, alerts, reports, and analytics, and to integrate the data and alerts with other security tools and systems, such as Crowdstrike, Zscaler, or ServiceNow.

You can also add more advanced search and alerting features to the script, such as support for multiple time ranges, search templates, and anomaly detection. This would allow you to perform more complex and sophisticated searches, and to detect and alert on more complex and subtle security threats and anomalies. You can also customize the alert actions and notifications in the script, such as the email recipients, subject, and body, and the webhooks, chatbots, and ticketing systems that are used to send the alerts. This would allow you to tailor the alerts to your specific needs and preferences, and to integrate them with your existing security and incident response processes and systems.

These are just a few examples of how you could enhance the script to fit your specific needs and requirements. There are many other ways that you could modify and extend the script, depending on your goals, objectives, and resources.
