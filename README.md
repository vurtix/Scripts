Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of scripts that I have been working on.

These scripts are designed to perform a variety of tasks, from automating mundane processes to analyzing data and generating reports. I have tried to make them as user-friendly and efficient as possible, and I hope you will find them useful in your own projects.

Be sure to review the code and adjust any settings or parameters as needed.
